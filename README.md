# MicrobeTools
Various scripts to convert data to work with the MicrobeVisualization Software


# Instructions

To use the scripts, currently need to put the files in the same folder as the scripts themselves, in either the .npy or .npz format. For every file with that extension in the folder will be read in and create .obj or .csv files with the relevant information. The .obj files are very rough masks, and need to be smoothed before they can be easily loaded into the MicrobeVisualizer.
